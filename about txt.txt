Hi, I'm Prosper Chimeremeze Eke! I recently graduated with a Business Administration degree from Covenant University. My passion lies in the exciting intersection of business and technology, particularly in the era of Industry 4.0.

									To pursue this goal, I've been actively honing my data analysis skills. I've completed the Google Data Analysis course and the Excel Skills for Business program by John Hopkins University, equipping me with the tools to tackle complex datasets.
									
									I'm a driven individual with a strong academic background (CGPA: 4.35) and a thirst for continuous learning. I'm eager to leverage my abilities to contribute to a data-driven and innovative work environment where I can make a real impact in the age of Industry 4.0.
